# Hi, I'm Bhaswati Chattopadhyay (Bhas) 👋

I'm a staff-level technical writer and content strategist with 9+ years of experience designing user-centered documentation for complex platforms. My work lives at the intersection of **AI/ML**, **developer experience**, and **inclusive design**.

At Microsoft, I contributed over 900 commits across private repositories for products like Viva Learning and People Skills, including Copilot-integrated features. This included 
drafting new articles, creating table of contents, and reviewing contributions from product, engineering, and support partners. 
I specialize in:

- 🧠 **AI-aware documentation** — Copilot, prompt QA, and LLM-guided interfaces
- 💡 **Content systems** — accessibility, privacy, localization, and inclusive terminology
- 🛠️ **Developer-facing docs** — SDK guides, admin setup flows, and UX microcopy
- 🎥 **Multimedia communication** — screencasts, video editing, and educational storytelling

I believe great content goes beyond helping. It also builds trust, bridges gaps, and lets people move forward with confidence.
